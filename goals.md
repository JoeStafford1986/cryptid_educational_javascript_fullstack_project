AIMS/PURPOSE:

To gain experience working in a team with other developers - to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome these
To have the opportunity to try using Agile working methods
To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project
To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module and have the opportunity to try some new things - the project is not focused on making an exciting end product, more on the process and teamwork.
To create a project using core Javascript - this means NO front-end frameworks or jQuery are allowed. If you have any questions about additional tools ask an instructor.
